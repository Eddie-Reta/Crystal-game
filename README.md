# Crystal Game
==============

I have built a small game which required me to learn JQUERY; it was an

assignment I had in my bootcamp as part of my learning experience.

Used HTML, CSS, and Javascript/JQUERY to complete this site.

# How  to Play

==============

* You will be given a random number at the start of the game.

* There are four crystals below. By clicking on a crystal you will add a specific amount of points to your total score.

* You win the game by matching your total score to the random number , you lose the game if your total score goes above the random number.

* The value of each crystal is hidden from view so, click away to add up your points.

* Each time the game starts,  the value of the crystals will change.

Yes I know same instructions from the site but, it helps in case you fly by them their listed once again! 

Enjoy!!!

Here is a small demo of how it works. :point_down:
